# Facebook-Scraper
Project Overview:
This project demonstrates my skills in web scraping, data processing, and automation. I developed a tool that scrapes truck listings from Facebook Marketplace, processes the data, and generates an interactive HTML report.

Key Features:
Automated scraping of Facebook Marketplace using Selenium WebDriver
Data parsing and cleaning with BeautifulSoup and Pandas
Generation of an interactive HTML report with custom styling
Customizable search parameters (price range, location)

Technologies Used:
Python 3.x
Selenium WebDriver
BeautifulSoup4
Pandas
HTML/CSS

Challenges and Solutions:
One of the main challenges was handling dynamic content on Facebook Marketplace. I overcame this by implementing scrolling functionality and wait times to ensure all content was loaded before scraping.

Results and Impact:
This tool significantly reduces the time needed to research truck listings, providing a clear, filterable report of available options. It demonstrates my ability to create practical solutions using web technologies and data processing techniques.
